What you get when you charter Darien:

* Possibly the best solo ocean rowing boat in the world
* Fully kitted out with sweet Garmin/Iridium nav & comms setup
* Deck speakers for rocking/chilling out on the waves
* Beacons galore and active radar reflector -- be safe, be seen
* Spacious and luxurious life raft and survival suit -- try not to use them
* Katadyn electric watermaker, hand-pumpable, membranes interchangeable with manual models
* Jetboil & gimbal for tasty hot cuisine
* Xcell Ocean oars
* Excessive solar -- no running out of power in cloudy weather!
* Massive list of included kit.
